##  Executive Summary

I am a **Software Engineer** with over **7 years of experience** specializing in **Safety-Critical AI** and **Autonomous Systems**. Holding a Master's degree, I focus on developing safe AI architectures compliant with **EASA aviation regulations** and **ISO 26262** standards.

My engineering approach is research-oriented, bridging the gap between theoretical safety constraints (ODD/MDD) and practical deployment in robotics and automated driving.
